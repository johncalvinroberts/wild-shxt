## Grindr

* 2009 - Other dating app giants at the time DID user research, which showed that users ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT geolocation-based dating app
* Founder just wanted to make Grindr because basically he thought it was cool. He just felt inspired to create it.
* 2016 - sold Grindr to a gaming company at $155 million value.
* Key Point: sometimes following a novel idea is enough to carry you very far
